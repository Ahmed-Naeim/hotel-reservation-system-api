## üîê User Roles

The API defines three user roles to manage permissions effectively:

* **Customer:** The default role for any new user. They can manage their profile, book rooms, and leave reviews.
* **Manager:** Appointed by a Super Admin. They have control over a specific hotel assigned to them, including managing its rooms and bookings.
* **Super Admin:** Has unrestricted access to all API resources. They can manage hotels, users, and assign roles.
